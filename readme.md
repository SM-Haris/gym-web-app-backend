This is the backend API for the GymUp gym management application, built with Node.js, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize. It provides the functionality to:

1. Manage user accounts (signup, login)
2. Process memberships and subscriptions (using Stripe - disabled in testing version)
3. Track member attendance
4. Generate member and revenue statistics

Database connection details are expected to be defined in environment variables.
Stripe API keys (for testing and production) should be configured in the .env file.
